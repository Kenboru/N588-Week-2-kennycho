# N588-Week-2-kennycho

The push dates for the files might be off, because I was having some confusion/troubles with making changes to, saving, and committing to the right files,
as well as making a new one for the final code push.

Also my group never explicitly had the chance to talk about how we wanted to perform our peer commentary so there was some confusion there too, at least
on my side.

I didn't do any specific formatting to make it look presentable when knitted, but I believe it looks ok.
